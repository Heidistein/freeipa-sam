## System Account Manager for FreeIPA  
![freeipa-sam.gif](freeipa-sam.gif)


FreeIPA-SAM is an interactive, menu-driven bash script for lifecycle management of system accounts.  

FreeIPA currently has no intuitive way to create, view, edit, or otherwise manage system accounts. This software aims to fill that gap.  

Usage is pretty straightforward, it is highly-recommended that you leave SSL enabled and configure the prerequisites before attempting an action.  

PRs and issues welcome, but support cannot be promised.  
Cheers!
